After some time I did some code to keep my coding skills in "Good Shape" (?).
To much management stuff for me lately.

I haven't found a way to do bulk deletes in Gmail UI, it doesn't work. There
were labels from mailing lists with 100K+ emails and UI gets stuck.

Take a look [here](https://github.com/diegows/toolbox/blob/master/mail/gmail_bulkdelete.py)

Check usage information at the top of the script and USE WITH CARE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY :)
