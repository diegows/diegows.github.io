Originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina, I bring over 25 years of experience in the technology sector, with a specialized focus on consulting in Linux and Open Source, Cloud Computing, DevOps, and, more recently, cybersecurity. My passion for technology extends beyond mere application; I am deeply committed to understanding the intricacies of how things work. This curiosity has not only fueled my knowledge but has also honed my skills as an adept problem-solver. Leveraging technology to find innovative solutions is what I love most, and I continuously strive to apply this enthusiasm to tackle complex challenges in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

My entrepreneurial journey began in 2010 when I embarked on a freelance career, laying the groundwork for what would become my own consulting company. Under my leadership, we achieved significant growth, expanding to a team of 50 professionals. At the end of 2022, I made the strategic decision to sell my company to MetabaseQ, stepping into a new role as the Director of DevSecOps and Cloud Services. Throughout these years, I have acquired extensive knowledge in business development, encompassing team building, business operations, sales, and marketing. This experience has not only expanded my technical expertise but also enriched my understanding of the business landscape, enabling me to drive success in both entrepreneurial and corporate settings.
