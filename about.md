About Diego Woitasen

I'm from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Founding partner of
[Flugel](https://flugel.it), I love solving any kind of problemas, specially 
technical ones. My IT career started 20+ years ago, working as Linux Specialist.
I embrace open source since high school, and I have an special interest for
Operating Systems and hardware architecture (logical, not physical).

In 2015, I've founder [Flugel](https://flugel.it) where we help B2B SaaS
Startups and Scaleups to build a solid cloud infrastructure and DevOps
methodologies. Our focus is SMB that are selling to big companies, where
security and compliance is mandatory.

This site is build with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted in Github
Pages.
